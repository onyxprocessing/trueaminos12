Introduction
The Comprehensive Rate and Transit Times API provides all the possible rate quotes and transit times for the applicable services for your packaging type along with rate quotes for FedEx One Rate service in a single rate request. This enables you to choose the best possible option as per your shipping needs. For FedEx Express services, it compares account specific standard rates, including FedEx One Rate and returns the lower rate quote.

Note:

Your account should be enabled for FedEx One Rate and FedEx Ground Economy services to get the rate quotes for the respective services.
FedEx One Rate service has certain dimensional and weight restrictions for shipments. Only the shipments that qualify the dimensional and weight conditions are eligible for FedEx One Rate.
The Comprehensive Rate and Transit Times API does not provide the rate quotes for FedEx freight services. To know about the rate quotes of FedEx freight service, visit the Freight LTL API docs page.
Benefits of Comprehensive Rate and Transit Times API
Enables you to get rate quotes for both FedEx One Rate and FedEx standard services for your packaging shipments.
Saves time by providing account-specific rates, FedEx One Rate, and rate quotes for all other applicable FedEx services including FedEx Ground and FedEx Express in a single rate request.
Improves the overall customer experience by systemically calculating the most accurate FedEx One Rate packaging type, when dimensions are provided.
Provides a more accurate rate quote and billing experience by reducing the number of unexpected additional shipping expenses.
Provides you with more options to meet your business needs by returning a complete portfolio of FedEx services with their corresponding rates and transit times.
Offers you the option to save money by comparing and choosing a less expensive service.
Comprehensive Rate and Transit Times API Details
This API provides you the flexibility to receive rate quotes for both FedEx One Rate services along with account specific discounted rates. Quotes can be for both FedEx packaging or for your packaging.

For more information refer Package types.

Note: FedEx Tube is not an accepted packaging type for this API.

Following are the features associated with this API:

Get all Rate Quotes in a Single Transaction
Get all rates (FedEx Ground Economy outbound, FedEx Express, FedEx One Rate, account specific rates) in a single transaction.
Transit time
Get transit times for services between source and destination.
Auto-Calculate Packaging Type
The volumetric calculation provides accurate packaging type for the shipment based on your specified dimensions.
Note:

To receive FedEx One Rate in the response, you must either specify a valid FedEx Packaging Type (Envelope, Pak, Small Box, Medium Box, Large Box, or Extra-Large Box) or select Your_Packaging and provide FedEx One Rate qualifying dimensions otherwise the API will only return the account specific/discounted rate quotes.
To receive a FedEx One Rate for an Envelope or Pak, you must specify the packaging type as Envelope or Pak respectively.
How Comprehensive Rate and Transit Times API Works
Comprehensive rate and transit times API works by performing a volumetric calculation based on the package dimensions provided for your packaging to the corresponding FedEx standard package types (Medium box, Large box etc.,), to determine if your package is eligible for One Rate services and provides the One Rate pricing along with the rate quotes for all the other applicable services.

Disclaimer to compatible shippers or any shipper looking to use the Ship API to create FedEx One Rate labels: Users must pass a FedEx Packaging Type of FEDEX_ENVELOPE, FEDEX_PAK, FEDEX_SMALL_BOX, FEDEX_MEDIUM_BOX, FEDEX_LARGE_BOX, or FEDEX_EXTRA_LARGE_BOX along with a Special Service Flag of FEDEX_ONE_RATE to receive One Rate pricing. Note if the Ship API passes a Packaging Type of YOUR_PACKAGING, FedEx One Rate will NOT apply however the customer will receive account specific rates. For more information on how to Ship FedEx One Rate using the Ship API please see the Ship API documentation or contact your FedEx representative.

Note:

If Your_Packaging type is selected but the dimensions are not specified, then the API will return all possible rate quotes including FedEx Express, FedEx Ground and Ground Economy services but not FedEx One Rate.
If Your_Packaging type is selected and dimensions and weight are specified, then the API will return all possible rate quotes including FedEx One Rate, FedEx Express, FedEx Ground and Ground Economy services.
If your package is not One Rate eligible then also you will receive the account specific rate quotes for the other applicable services but not for FedEx One Rate.
Below volumetric and weight conditions are checked to determine the eligibility of a package for FedEx One Rate.
